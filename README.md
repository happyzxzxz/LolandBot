# LolandBot
Music bot for discord, made with wavelink 3.0 beta and lavasrc plugin. Also capable of openai DALL-E requests, openai chatgpt requests and gelbooru requests.
At the moment there are no quick one script quick startup. Enter all variables in the .env file (planning to make it selective later) and run main.py. Don't forget to launch lavalink server in the Lavalink folder
